## FocusTV
![alt text](https://github.com/Jakegwizdak/FocusTV/blob/main/Settings%20Screenshot.png?raw=true)

Easily move everything to your TV screen (or any screen) when you want to watch on your PC from your bed or couch, plus more. This simple background application will 'focus' on the screen of choice when the user configured keybind is pressed- which toggles between turning focus on or off. When focus is activated and continously thereafter, all windows that are not currently on the focused screen get moved to the focused screen and their size set accordingly (applications can be added to a blacklist to stop them from being moved/resized). The cursor also gets moved to the focused screen, and can optionally be kept within its bounds. Additionally, the audio device setting can swap the audio output to any desired output when focus is activated. When focus is deactivated, all windows are restored to their previous location/size, the output audio device is set back to what it was previously, and the cursor is moved back to the primary screen. Uses the [AudioDeviceCmdlets](https://github.com/frgnca/AudioDeviceCmdlets) library.

### INSTALLATION:
Simply download the latest release [here](https://github.com/Jakegwizdak/FocusTV/releases) and extract the folder. Place the extracted folder anywhere you like, and run the .exe file inside the folder to start the application (by default no window is opened when starting the application).

### USAGE:
Press the configurable keybind combination to toggle between focus on or off. In order to access the settings menu, open the system tray menu at the bottom right of the taskbar, right click the FocusTV icon and select 'Settings'.
